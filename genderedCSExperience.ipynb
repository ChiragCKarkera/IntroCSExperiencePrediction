    "I am interested in identify the leading indicators of experience broken down by gender in introductory CS at an elite research university like Berkeley. In short, I want to find the attributes that split the dataset as *purely* as possible into male and female.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, I will undertake the following course of action:\n",
    "1. Explore the dataset\n",
    "    - Usually, I would explore the dataset to ensure its integrity and understand the context. But in this case, I will skip this step since I designed the study and collected the data, as such, I am well versed of the context. Further, I have done previous work on this dataset, so I know its boundaries.\n",
    "2. Identify features that may be used. \n",
    "    - If possible, engineer features that might provide greater discrimination.\n",
    "3. With the understanding that this a `classification` task, explore a couple of classifiers that might be well suited for the problem at hand.\n",
    "    - Random Forest classifier\n",
    "    - eXtreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) trees classifier\n",
    "    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "    - Decision Tree classifier\n",
    "4.  Select appropriate classifier based on evaluation metric and tune it for optimality.\n",
    "5.  Extract top features responsible for discriminating the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will tackle steps one and two. This [notebook](https://github.com/omoju/genderCSExperience/blob/master/featureImportance.ipynb) will focus on steps three through five.\n",
